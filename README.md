# DreamHub

**Run Stable Diffusion on recent Android devices**

> [!NOTE]
> This is a **fork** of [xororz/local-dream](https://github.com/xororz/local-dream),
> focused on **build CI** and **UI redesign**.
>
> This fork adapts the codebase to older Android SDK releases and
> removs experimental Material3 APIs that were present in upstream.
> The frontend and backend are refactored for an improved architecture
> with redesigned intuitive UI, task queue support, history save/export/import and many more.

## User Guide 

No standalone manual provided here. 
Please refer to the upstream [user guide](https://ld-guide.chino.icu/) 
of [xororz/local-dream](https://github.com/xororz/local-dream).

## Version

The app version lives in **[VERSION_NAME](VERSION_NAME)** and **[VERSION_CODE](VERSION_CODE)** at the repository root:

```
VERSION_NAME     → 2026.06.12.16.01    # versionName: YYYY.MM.DD.HH.mm (UTC)
VERSION_CODE     → 244                 # versionCode: Google-style +1 per release
```

`build.gradle.kts` reads these files to set `versionName` (used as-is) and
`versionCode`.  CI enforces the format at
the start of each build and fails immediately if VERSION_NAME does not match the
pattern.
